#Test Task for Elif Tech

Simple delivery web app.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install elif.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```python
# In order to fully run the app you need .env file with the secrets, it is not the best idea to share them over github. So if you want to get it just send me a message in WA +380635777602 or email pavlovovzhynskyy@gmail.com or use it under the [link](https://elif-delivery.netlify.app)
```

```bash
#cd/client      #cd/server
#npm i          #npm i
#npm run dev    #npm run dev
```

## Important
```
Back is hosted on free service so it may take some time when first loading the app. If it crashes update the page.
All the data which is rendered from backend might be empty by first load for aproximately 10 seconds 
```
